# theobibs
A collection of BibTeX files useful for pastors and theologians.  Prepared and managed by Rev. Caleb R. Bassett.

I have created this repository to house a collection of BibTeX files (plain text bibliographies) that are useful for use by pastors and theologians.

## How to use

I use the application [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net) to browse the bibliography. I tend to add entries to the bibliography in plain text, often using [Textmate](https://macromates.com).

You can usually import a BibTeX file into a variety of professional citation managers. Of course, if you know what BibTeX is then you know it's most powerful use is in connection with LaTeX.
