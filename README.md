# theobibs
A collection of BibTeX files useful for pastors and theologians.  Prepared and managed by Rev. Caleb R. Bassett.

I have created this repository to house a collection of BibTeX files (plain text bibliographies) that are useful for pastors and theologians.

## How to use

I use the application [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net) to browse the bibliography. I tend to add entries to the bibliography in plain text, often using [TextMate](https://macromates.com). I have found the [OttoBib](https://www.ottobib.com) service to be a useful and time-saving starting point for BibTeX entries.

You can usually import a BibTeX file into a variety of professional citation managers. And, of course, if you know what BibTeX is then you probably know that its most powerful use is within LaTeX documents.
